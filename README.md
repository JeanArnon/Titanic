# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

These notebooks were created for the Titanic Kaggle competition. 

In the first version - titanic-competition - the score is 77%.

The second one - titanic-keras - the score is over 79%.

The main difference between these two is that in the first one, I used Random Forests as the model. In the second one, I used Keras with TensorFlow.
